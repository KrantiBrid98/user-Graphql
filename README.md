# user-Graphql

## Objective:
- To implement graphql basics right from adding querys and mutation in schema.
- ApolloServer has been used here. 
- ApolloClient has been used to store data
- This app allows the user to Add(Create) a new user, Display(Read) the list of Users, and Delete a particular user
- Json-server has been created as a db to store the list of Users.

## Development
- `npm run run-dev` This will start the server on http://localhost:3000/users, start the react app on http://localhost:5000/ and runs the GraphQl playground on http://localhost:4000/graphql
